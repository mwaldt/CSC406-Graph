# CSC406 -Algorithms and Data Structures
Graph Project
Multiple phases of graph project merged, directed and undirected graphs implemented in java

Usage:
The project contains a compile batch script and a series of run scripts for the windows operating system.
The class files are not tracked on github and nor should the output files.
Must compile for the first time on a new system and then run the appropraite run script.

Directed Graph:
This was the first phase of the graph project, includes weighted and unweighted Adjaceny Matrix and Adjacency List representations of directed graphs
completed for class on 2/11/16

Undirected Graph:
This is the second phase of the project, includes weighted and unweighted Adjaceny Matrix and Adjacency List representations of undirected graphs
completed for class on 3/3/16

Algorithms:
This is the third phase of the project. This part includes code for Union Find, Kruskal's MST, Kahn's and Tarjan's algorithms for Topological sort.
